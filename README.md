## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned
- In this projects I explored various ways of form validation using JS. I thought about using regex but went with using the ```validity``` property of form elements.

### Useful resources

- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Forms/Form_validation) - The definitive guide to building forms with validation using JS.
